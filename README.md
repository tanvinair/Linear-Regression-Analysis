# Linear-Regression-Analysis
 The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset, perform preprocessing and  exploratory data analysis (EDA), and then build two different models for regression:   1. Stochastic Gradient Descent using the SGDRegressor library of Scikit-learn.  2. Ordinary Linear Regression using the statsmodels library.
